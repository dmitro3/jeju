# Preload test setup to ensure infrastructure is running

# Test timeout (30 seconds)

# Retry flaky tests once
retry = 1

# Test pattern - match .test.ts and .spec.ts files but NOT in frontend/
# Note: Playwright tests are in frontend/tests/*.spec.ts and should be run with npx playwright test
# The bun test command should be: bun test src tests (not bun test with no args)
